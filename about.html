                <img src="images/mayor.jfif" class="img-fluid rounded-2 float-start" alt="...">
                governance for the year of 2013 from the governance organization in
                December 2013. The head of the public committee for choosing the award
                winners was the former president of the Supreme Court, the judge Mishael
                Cheshin and the members of the Committee are: Proffessor Chalil Abu
                Dhaalu, journalist Meirav Arlozorof from "The Marker", the former
                Minister, Moshe Kahlon , attorney Miri Ben- Shoshan , Sderot
                municipality's comptroller and Eliad Shraga , the chairman of the
                governance organization. The reasons he was granted the award were
                written as follows: "Mayor Moti Sasson, who has been the mayor of Holon
                for 20 years, was born and raised in Holon. As mayor, he led the city to
                an unprecedented urban-cultural development and also to outstanding
                educational achievements while upholding the values of good governance.
                When Mr. Sasson received the city of Holon, it had a negative image and
                a financial deficit. He succeeded to transform it into a city with
                outstanding municipals, cultural and educational achievements and
                repackaged the city as the "Israeli city of children". He established
                the Holon Children Museum, green parks, Mediatheque library, Holon
                Cinematheque, The Israeli Center for Digital Art, Design Museum Holon
                and more. That changed the city dramatically. His uncompromising
                innovative spirit resulted in the city of Holon winning "The Five Beauty
                Stars" award from Council for a Beautiful Israel for 15 consecutive
                years. Mr. Sasson with extreme devotion successfully contributed to the
                city of Holon for more than 20 years, while upholding the values of good
                governance and can serve as an example for other mayors. He is known for
                encouraging improvements in environmental quality and for his work in
                the field of youth environmental education. For his work as a senior and
                loyal elected official and his role in leading the outstanding
                achievements of the city of Holon including promoting infrastructure,
                fostering the arts, and encouraging improvements to environmental
                quality and for serving in such a position for a great duration while
                upholding the values of good governance. For all these Moti Sasson
                received a governance award for 2013 in the category of local
                authority". In 2010, Holon Mayor Moti Sasson was named by Britain’s
                Monocle magazine as one of the 10 “freshest movers and shakers in urban
                politics worldwide.” Sasson, the article said, has "put a midsize
                bedroom community on the world's cultural map,” and the writers praised
                Sasson’s effort "to consolidate Holon's position as the Middle East's
                cultural center." Moti Sasson, who was born and raised in Holon, starts
                his work day with a stroll through the streets of his beloved city. He
                graduated from Bialik Elementary School and Kugel High School, and spent
                his childhood playing in the city's sand dunes. Sasson holds a B.A. in
                Arabic language and literature and the history of the Middle East, as
                well as an M.A. in business administration. From 1976-1984 he managed
                the budget department of the National Insurance Institute. From
                1984-1989 he was deputy mayor of Holon, and served as chairman of its
                Budget Committee, chairman of the Human Resources Committee, chairman of
                the Investment Committee, was a member of the board of directors of two
                municipal subsidiary companies and deputy chairman of the Regional
                Association for Firefighting Services. In 1993, Sasson was elected
                mayor, and is now serving his fourth term. He also chairs the board of
                three municipal subsidiary companies: the Economic Co. for Holon
                Development ltd, the Recreation and Entertainment Company and the
                Company for the Development of Theater, Music and Art. Since 1999 Sasson
                is also a member of the board of directors of the Mifal Hapayis Lottery
                and a member of the Culture and Art Committee of Mifal Hapayis, serving
                also as chairman of this committee. During his tenure, Sasson has led
                Holon to significant achievements and it is widely recognized as a
                well-run and innovative city, a leader in a number of fields. It is a
                place where people like to live, and attracts visitors from throughout
                the country and from all over the world. One of Sasson's top priorities
                has been education in general and education toward values and good
                citizenship in particular. As the leader of the “Children's City”, he
                wants to provide each and every child an opportunity to succeed. He
                often emphasizes the importance of keeping children in school, believing
                this is no less important than having them achieve high grades or
                improve the city's matriculation averages. A prime example of this
                approach is the MAOR center – the Municipal Center for Evaluation and
                Treatment of Learning Disabilities – which was personally initiated by
                Sasson. It demonstrates how he expects the educational system to provide
                each and every student all the assistance he or she needs to fulfill
                their potential, regardless of their family’s financial status.</p>

        Adloyada (Hebrew: עדלאידע Hebrew pronunciation: adlojada, lit.
        "Until one no longer knows") is a humorous procession held in Israel on
        the Jewish holiday of Purim (or in Shushan Purim the second day of
        Purim, commanded to be celebrated in "walled cities", nowadays only in
        Jerusalem).The Adloyada parade is a tradition dating back to the
        early days of Tel Aviv, in 1912. During the days of the Yishuv, the
        Adloyada was a mass event; it was resumed after the state of Israel was
        established. The name is derived from the rabbinic saying in the Talmud
        that one should revel on Purim by drinking "until one no longer knows"
        (Aramaic: עַד דְּלָא יָדַע ʿad dəlāʾ yāḏaʿ) the difference between
        "blessed be Mordecai" and "cursed be Haman". The first Adloyada
        parade was initiated by Avraham Aldema, a teacher and co-founder of
        "Hevre Trasek", and was held in Tel Aviv during Purim in 1912. This
        parade was characterized by provocative costumes and pranks. According
        to several testimonies, the parade of 1912 was very colorful and
        beautiful. It consisted of giant puppets, a marching band and hundreds
        of children wearing their Purim costumes. Throughout the years, the
        parade became a permanent tradition of Purim. These events were held
        parallel to the famous celebrations that were organized by Baruch
        Agadati. Agadati's merriments had become extremely profitable, and so
        were criticized harshly by "Hevre Trasek" for being over commercialized.
        Tel Aviv's Adloyadas were complemented with luxurious Purim balls,
        created by Baruch Agadati. Throughout the years, the parades were
        expanded and their path was moved from Herzl Street to Allenby Street
        and to Ibn Gabirol Street upon the establishment of the state of Israel.
        During the 1930s, every Adloyada had a specific theme, for example the
        tribes of Israel (in 1934), and the achievements of the Yishuv. During
        that time, Tel Aviv's Purim events attracted many tourists from all
        around Israel and from abroad. As opposed to European states, where
        carnivals were a means to break loose and consisted of extreme
        licentiousness, aggressiveness and protest,[citation needed] the Tel
        Aviv event had different features. The main carnival, despite its new
        name Adloyada, was characterized by a "proper" behavior. The
        municipality issued annual limitations on the Purim celebrations such as
        a prohibition to use explosives and dress up in costumes that may offend
        the Jewish religion or the Israeli nation. Despite the censorship and
        the sanctions, there were a few costumes and parades that didn't obey
        the rules and used the public festivity to express social protest, and
        thus made their mark on the city. During the 1928 carnival, with the
        theme "10 years to the national home", Hevre Trasek presented a
        10-candle Menorah (as a symbol to Balfour's statement); instead of
        candles there was a rude gesture and the sign "free Aliya, Jews in the
        top clerical work". In one of the "Menorah" balls (Menorah was a club
        founded by veterans) in 1927, Avraham Atkind won the costume competition
        for his costume: "balancing the clerk's salary in the Palestine
        government". Atkind's hat had a scale and a photograph of the residence
        of the British commissioner in the magnificent Augusta Victoria building
        in Mount Scopus, as well as a poem, expressing the discontent of the gap
        between the British clerk's salary and the salaries of local Israelis
        from all ethnic groups. Gdud Meginei Hasafa (Hebrew: גדוד מגיני השפה,
        Battalion for the Defence of the Language), an organization in Tel Aviv
        fighting to make Hebrew the common language in Mandatory
        Palestine,[5][6] used Purim to present and to flood the streets with
        written propaganda. The Gdud documents were distributed during the Purim
        carnival. In addition, the Gdud held an annual costume competition with
        the theme of the superiority and importance of the Hebrew language. In
        the carnival of 1929, the Gdud presented the "tower of Babylon"; a tower
        on top of a horse-drawn cart with the slogan "revival of the language,
        revival of the people" and "words can kill". In the main carnival of
        1933, there was a puppet of Hitler riding a horse, as part of the
        parade. On its neck there was a sign saying; "kill Jews" and next to it
        there were 2 Jews bleeding to death. The German consul in Jerusalem sent
        a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Meir Dizengoff in the matter and demanded an
        apology, but Dizengoff replied that Purim is a stage for free speech of
        public opinion. A year later, a huge puppet was presented with a
        swastika on its back. In 1935, a giant puppet was built, named "the
        profiteering monster". On the day of festivities, a public trial was
        held for the puppet, during which Dizengoff, Menachem Ussishkin, Chaim
        Weizmann and Yehoshua Hankin ruled that the monster was guilty of
        various crimes including fraud, spending the people's wealth, and
        destruction of the achievements of the pioneers. In one of the later
        carnivals, a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in order to
        protest racism in the United States. While Purim festivals became
        central public events in the 1920s and 1930s for expressing current
        social issues, the holiday events, overall and despite exceptions, were
        aimed to strengthen national messages and dominant ideologies. As
        opposed to its Biblical origin, where Purim constitutes "an opposite
        world" (the fool becomes the king and the king is presented as a fool
        around town), in Tel Aviv the holiday was institutionalized to conserve
        the social hierarchy and the parades were led by the city's mayor Meir
        Dizengoff, astride a horse. During the Second World War, the Adloyada
        tradition was extinguished.
