          The largest Purim procession in the country takes place every year in
          the city of Holon and is the culmination of community and
          organizational activity that takes place during the year and
          intensifies in preparation for the holiday. The procession, which
          focuses on a different central theme each time, is attended by
          thousands of marchers, including: Holon school students, class
          participants in community centers and cultural and sports centers,
          bands of gymnasts, stuntmen and acrobats, musicians and dancers,
          street theater groups, and of course huge, colorful performances.
          Which are the most exciting and impressive part. Alongside the
          marchers from Holon, guests from all over the country and sometimes
          even from around the world participate in Adlaide.
          <img
            src="images/card img.jpg"
            alt="parade van"
            class="img-fluid rounded m-3 w-50 float-start"
          />
          The Adlaide walks along the main streets of Holon in front of hundreds
          of thousands of spectators of all ages. The march usually ends with a
          show and a colorful and especially cheerful street party in the square
          in front of the municipality. From the end of the Adlaide to the end
          of the Purim holiday, the exhibits that participated in the procession
          for the enjoyment of passers-by and returnees are placed in the
          Meditech plaza. The Adloyada tradition was renewed in the Purim of 1955. In the late sixties, the tradition disintegrated in Tel Aviv and the parade was transferred to Holon, although it lacked the unrefined feature of events in the small Tel Aviv.

          In the 80's an ArchiParhiTura (also spelled ArchiParchiTura;  was introduced in Haifa. It was a Purim parade which had giant displays made by Technion architecture students ("ArchiParhiTura" is the Hebrew combination of the words architecture and "archi parhi"- which is the biblical expression of vagabond) and set on trucks. The parade went through Herzl Street in the Hadar Hacarmel area and was accompanied by an orchestra.
          
          In the last few years, an attempt was made to return to tradition and resume the Adloyada as an important main event in different cities.
          <img
            src="images/card img 2.jpg"
            alt="kids marching"
            class="img-fluid rounded m-3 w-50 float-end"
          />
          In the beginning, the parade was called "carnival". In 1923, a
          competition was held in order to find a new permanent name for the
          parade. Out of 300 submissions, author Isaac Dov Berkowitz's entry
          Adloyada was chosen. Adloyada means reaching a state of total
          intoxication. The expression comes from the Aramaic expression stated
          by Rabbah in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megilla: "It is the duty
          of a man to mellow himself ... on Purim until he cannot tell the
          difference between 'cursed be Haman' and 'blessed be Mordecai'."This
          means that people should drink on Purim until he reaches a state of
          not being able to distinguish between the evil Haman and the blessed
          Mordecai. Among the other submitted suggestions were Hayim Nahman
          Bialik's entry "Pura", Tchernichovsky's entry "Astoret" and Avraham
          Shlonsky's entry "Tzahalula". In 1935, a giant puppet was built, named "the profiteering monster". On the day of festivities, a public trial was held for the puppet, during which Dizengoff, Menachem Ussishkin, Chaim Weizmann and Yehoshua Hankin ruled that the monster was guilty of various crimes including fraud, spending the people's wealth, and destruction of the achievements of the pioneers.

          In one of the later carnivals, a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in order to protest racism in the United States.
          
          While Purim festivals became central public events in the 1920s and 1930s for expressing current social issues, the holiday events, overall and despite exceptions, were aimed to strengthen national messages and dominant ideologies. As opposed to its Biblical origin, where Purim constitutes "an opposite world" (the fool becomes the king and the king is presented as a fool around town), in Tel Aviv the holiday was institutionalized to conserve the social hierarchy and the parades were led by the city's mayor Meir Dizengoff, astride a horse.
          
          During the Second World War, the Adloyada tradition was extinguished.

              Osem-Nestle is an Israeli food group that produces and markets a
              wide variety of products of the highest standards. Bamba, Beasley,
              flakes, soup almonds, ketchup, Tivol and Matrena are just a small
              part of the well-known and beloved brands of the group, which can
              be found in every home in Israel. In the 1990s, a strategic
              partnership began between Osem and Nestlé, the global food giant,
              which grew stronger until the merger of the two companies in 2016.
              Today, Osem is an integral part of Nestlé, which places it not
              only at the forefront of the Israeli food industry, but also in
              the first line of global food manufacturers. The group's global
              activities began in 1959, out of a desire to enable Jewish
              communities around the world to eat kosher food. Over the years
              the activity grew and expanded, and today the main areas of
              activity are managed through the company Osem USA, which operates
              in the USA and markets kosher food products and gluten-free
              products under the Gratify brand, based on the extensive
              experience gained by the group over the years in which it produced
              gluten-free pastries. Today, Osem USA markets With great success
              the Bamba brand to hundreds of points of sale in the USA.

              Eden mineral water is high-quality natural water, tasty and rich
              in minerals that the body needs. The power of water - with you in
              every sip. Mineral water begins with rainwater that permeates for
              years through the layer of basalt rocks in the south of the Golan
              Heights, absorbing the unique mineral composition that gives them
              their familiar and beloved taste. The water is pumped and reaches
              the factory that meets the strictest international quality
              standards. There, they are carefully packed without human contact
              - nothing is added to them and nothing is taken away from them.
              Eden Water Factory performs control processes on an ongoing basis
              to ensure that you drink natural, healthy and high-quality mineral
              water at all times. When you sip Eden water, you sip the power of
              mineral water, just as nature intended.

              Goldstar is a red lager beer with a unique flavor and aroma and
              4.9% alcohol. The beer is made according to a recipe that is more
              than 60 years old, from a mixture of both light roasted and dark
              roasted malt, in a traditional process that gives it its deep
              flavor. In recent years Goldstar has become synonymous with the
              ‘authentic’ Israeli: the rough, witty, self-conscious (well,
              partially self-conscious) man or the woman who knows what’s what.
